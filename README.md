# A Vector class for the Arduino
This vector class contains the most important functionalities,
which can also be found in the standard C++ vector class.
It is intended for the small memory space of the Arduino.
Therefore some deductions were made:
For example the maximum length of the vector was reduced to 65535 (16 bit).

## Note

There are some (minor) differences from the standard C++ vector class.
